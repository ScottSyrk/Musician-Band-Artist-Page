    <h1>Spice Girls</h1>
    </center>
    <h2>Some information about the group</h2>
    <p>Spice Girls are a British girl group that went popular in the 90s. The group has long disbanded but they are still popular among their fans-including me! I first found out about Spice Girls when I was around 7. If I remember correctly, it was the first pop group I listened to, and they were very popular in the 90s, so it was very easy to hear their music at stores or malls, as well as on the TV on music video channels.</p>
    <p>Spice Girls consisted of 5 girls, each of whom had a unique personality and style. Mel B was the Scary Spice, acting spontaneous and making fun, crazy faces. Melanie C was the Sporty Spice, usually seen wearing athletic outfits and performing athletic dances and moves in music videos. Emma was Baby Spice, portraying a type of person who usually comes off friendly, kind, sweet and joyful. Geri was the Ginger Spice, likely because of her hair color and she was also very energetic. Finally Victoria was the Posh Spice, always elegant, stylish and had an air of confidence. They were likely mostly popular with the younger generation of the 90s and they became pop culture icons, with many achievements in the industry, such as merchandise, movies and sponsorship deals with brands</p>
    <h2>Why I love their music</h2>
    <p>Not only were they the first girl group I listened to regularly, but also it was important for me because it was also a period where I began learning English at school and listening to their music allowed to me begin practicing English by enjoying music in that particular language. Since I really liked their music and their music videos, it increased my interest in the English language. As years went by, and listening to many albums they made, I eventually found out about other artists and bands, especially American artists. However, Spice Girls have always been at the core of my favorite memories from my childhood years.</p>
